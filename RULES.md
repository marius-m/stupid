# Rules for the game

A basic game where the main objective is to get rid of your cards. The one that is left with all the cards is 'Stupid'.

- Main objective: Get rid of all your cards after there are no cards in the refilling deck.
- The play consists of a series of bouts. During each bout there is an **ATTACKER** and a **DEFENDER**.
- The **ATTACKER** begins by playing any card from hand. To beat off the attack the **DEFENDER** will have to beat this and all subsequent attacking cards. A card which is not a trump can be beaten by playing a **higher card of the same suit, or by any trump**. **A trump card can only be beaten by playing a higher trump**. 
- Alternatively, **if the defender cannot or does not wish to beat off the attack, which then becomes part of the defender's hand**
- If all attacks are defended and there is nothing to throw in, in this case the attack has succeeded.

- If the defender beats the first attack card, the attacker can continue the attack by playing another card. If the defender beats this second attack card too, the attack can be continued with further cards, subject to the following conditions:
  - each new attack card must be of the **same rank as some card already played during the current bout** - either an attack card or a card played by the defender
  - the total number of cards played by the attackers during a bout **must never exceed six**
  - if the defender had fewer than six cards before the bout, the number of cards played by the attackers must not be more than the number of cards in the defender's hand.

- The defender succeeds in beating off the whole attack if either:
  - the defender has beaten all the attack cards played so far, and none of the defender's opponents is able and willing to continue the attack;
  - the defender succeeds in beating six attacking cards;
  - the defender has no cards left in hand, all the defender's cards having been used to beat attack cards.

- When an attack is beaten off, all the cards played during the bout are thrown face down on a discard heap and are not used again during the play of this deal. The defender becomes the attacker for the next bout.
