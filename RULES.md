# Rules for the game

A basic game where the main objective is to get rid of your cards. The one that is left with all the cards is 'Stupid'.

- Main objective: Get rid of all your cards after there are no cards in the refilling deck.
- Each player will get a round when he could have a turn to throw out its cards.
  - Attacking player may throw any card it wants
  - Defending player must 'defend' itself with a higher card (SAME SUITE, HIGHER RANK)
  - Any player that is not defending may throw in more cards to be defended (must follow SAME SUITE or SAME RANK that is already on the table)
  - Defending player may switch who is defending by throwing in a card with the SAME RANK
- Each game has a TRUMP SUITE. 
  - TRUMP SUITE will counter any regular card SUITE
  - When trying to counter TRUMP SUITE, HIGHER RANK
- If defending player cannot defend itself (there are more attacking cards on the table than he was able to counter them), it has to collect all the cards on the table. 
- When there are no more cards on the playing deck to be countered, the cards "rests" into resting deck and those cards will not return for the play.
